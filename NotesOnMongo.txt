When you install mongodb, the thing that does the job is mongod.exe (daemon)

Add environmentvariables->path, the bin folder in C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin
after that run cmd, and run -> mongod.
you should see an exception telling that c:\data\db is not existent, which is the default folder mongodb stores the databases.
